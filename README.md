Hi Team Hubdoc!

Welcome to my Github profile & take a look around. I learned quite a bit and I hope you like my coding choices.

<h3> Notes </h3>
1) Solution is built with Nightmare.<br>
2) Please look for Resultfile.csv in the same folder you run the scraper (scraper.js) in.  <br>
3) Sometimes it returns with an error ("unable to find element .click('.rc >.r > a')") I think it may have to do with running the program more than once in a short time frame , but just in case it doesn't , run scraper.js again. <br>

<h3> Warmups </h3>

I may add more warmup exercises to the repo over the coming week or so.

Finished:

Warmup 7

<h3>Related </h3>

I had built another scraper in November of last year under this repo (if you're curious): https://github.com/Anthematics/Scraper .
