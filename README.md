Hi Hubdocs!

Welcome to my Github profile, take a look around ! I hope you like my coding choices.

The version of Node I am using here is 8.11.2.

The scraper up until July 24th also properly grabbed salary data - I will try to come back, unhide the salary data and get it as well (hopefully before Wednesday)

I had built another scraper in November of last year under this repo (if you're curious): https://github.com/Anthematics/Scraper
