Hi Team Hubdoc!

Welcome to my Github profile & take a look around ! I hope you like my coding choices.

*Please git pull end of day Wednesday since I have one final STUBBORN issue to sort out.*

<h3> Issues </h3>

Scraper formatting was fixed last night but does not pull salary data , scraper today pulls salary data but needs format fix.
Also occasionally it throws the error unable to find '.rc >.r > a' -> I rerun the file since it is intermittant it seems.

My other branch ('formatting') has better formatting but no salary data.
