Hi Team Hubdoc!

Welcome to my Github profile & take a look around ! I hope you like my coding choices.

The scraper at this moment (July 24) does not seem to grab salary data - I will try to come back, unhide the salary data and get it added to the table as well (hopefully before Wednesday)

I had built another scraper in November of last year under this repo (if you're curious): https://github.com/Anthematics/Scraper

Feel free to email me at Jasonharder2@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Regards , Jason
