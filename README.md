Hi Team Hubdoc!

Welcome to my Github profile & take a look around ! I hope you like my coding choices.

*Please git pull Wednesday morning since I have one final issue to sort out*

<h3> Issues </h3>

Scraper formatting was fixed last night but does not pull salary data , scraper today pulls salary data but needs format fix.
Also occasionally it throws the error unable to find '.rc >.r > a' -> I rerun the file since it is intermittant it seems.

I had built another scraper in November of last year under this repo (if you're curious): https://github.com/Anthematics/Scraper
